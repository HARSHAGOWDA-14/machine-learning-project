 Student Grade Analyzer

A beginner-friendly **Python Data Analysis Project** that analyzes student grades using **Jupyter Notebook**.  
This project demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** â€“ perfect for showcasing as a fresher in Data Science or Python development.

Project Motivation
Education data holds valuable insights into student performance. This project was built to:
- Understand how student scores vary across different subjects
- Identify top-performing and under-performing students
- Practice **real-world data cleaning and analysis** using Python
- Present findings using clear **data visualizations**

This repository acts as both a **portfolio project** and a **learning journey**.

Features
         Import and explore student grade datasets
         Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
         Calculate average, maximum, and minimum scores
         Identify top and bottom performing students
         Generate visualizations (bar charts, histograms, pie charts, etc.)
         Easy-to-follow notebook with step-by-step explanations

Tech Stack
**Python 3**  
 **Jupyter Notebook**  
 **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation & analysis  
 **NumPy** â€“ Numerical operations  
**Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization

  Dataset
    - The project uses a **sample dataset of student grades** (CSV format).
    - Each record typically contains:
    - Student Name / ID  
    - Subject-wise Scores  
    - Total Marks / Percentage  

*(You can replace this dataset with your own to test different scenarios.)*
